The list itself is here: [Skyrim 2023 Mega Mod List](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/82863).

The Wabbajack files are here: [Enhanced and Modernized - Wabbajack Modlist](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93277).

## Installation Guide

#### Step One: Prepare Skyrim
Uninstall Skyrim completely from your system. Then delete the whole Steam directory, which is typically something like *~\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition*. Also delete the Skyrim folder at *~\Documents\My Games*.

Now we're going to reinstall it! Install the game.

After doing this, you should have a **completely unmodified Skyrim installation**.

Now launch Skyrim through Steam. Let the launcher set a graphics preset, and then load to Skyrim's main menu. You should get the popup to download the Anniversary Edition Creation Club content. Go ahead and download all those. Once all the creations are downloaded, exit Skyrim entirely.

At this point you should have a stock installation of Skyrim AE.
Let's move on.

#### Step Two: Accounts
Create an account for the following websites if you don't already have one:
- [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/)
- [LoversLab](https://www.loverslab.com/)

#### Step Three: Acquire Wabbajack
Go to [Wabbajack.org](https://www.wabbajack.org/) and download the program.

Place the downloaded executable somewhere outside of any protected files. I have it placed in *C:\Modding\Wabbajack*. When you run this Wabbajack executable, is will automatically download the latest version of the entire Wabbajack program.

Once you've launched Wabbajack, click the settings button in the top right. Connect to your LoversLab and Nexus accounts.

#### Step Four: Prepare the Enhanced and Modernized installer.
Download the .wabbajack file from its [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93277) page.

Before actually using this file, we need to prepare for where the modlist is going to go.
Create an empty directory, also outside of any protected folders, for where everything will be installed. For example, *C:\Games\Skyrim_EnhancedAndModernized*.

Open up Wabbajack if you closed it. Press the "Install from Disk" button. There are three options that must be configured:
- Target Modlist: Set this to the Enhanced and Modernized .wabbajack file.
- Modlist Installation Location: Point this to where you decided the installed modlist will go.
- Resource Download Location: This is where all the mod archives will be downloaded to. This could be anywhere, but make sure you have enough space!

#### Step Five: Modlist Installation
Click the play button to the right of the config options to begin installation.
