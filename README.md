# Enhanced and Modernized
Github page for the Skyrim load order Enhanced and Modernized.

The list itself is here: [Skyrim 2023 Mega Mod List](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/82863).

## Requirements

- Skyrim Special Edition from either Steam (1.6.640) or GOG (1.6.659).
- The Anniversary Edition upgrade.
- A 64-bit operating system.

## Installation Guide

### Step One: Prepare Your Computer
To help make the game run as well as possible, you need to increase the size of the page file.

- Start typing "Advanced system settings" into your Windows search bar, and select "View Advanced System Settings" when it appears.
- Switch to the Advanced tab.
- Press the Settings button in the performance section.
- Switch to the Advanced tab (again).
- Press the Change button in the "Virtual memory" section.
- Uncheck the box that auto-manages page file size.
- Select whatever drive you plan to install Skyrim on.
- Select the "Custom size" option.
- Set the minimum to at least 20480 (20GB), and the maximum to something higher (recommended: 40960 (40GB)).
  - You need to have enough free space on your drive to fit the whole page file, even after intsalling this list.
- Press "Set" to commit your changes.
- Keep pressing OK until you get out of all the settings windows.
- Restart your computer.

*I don't care how much RAM you have; you need to do this.*

### Step Two: Prepare Skyrim
Uninstall Skyrim completely from your system. Then delete the whole Skyrim SE directory, which is typically something like *~\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition*. Also delete the Skyrim folder at *~\Documents\My Games*.

We're going to reinstall it! Install the game. If you're on GOG, make sure to download all the DLC content too.

Now launch Skyrim. Let the launcher set a graphics preset, and then load to Skyrim's main menu. If you haven't downloaded the CC content yet, go ahead and do so. Exit the game afterwards.

After doing all this, you should have a **completely vanilla Skyrim AE installation**.
Let's move on.

### Step Three: Accounts
Create an account for the following websites if you don't already have one:
- [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/)
- [LoversLab](https://www.loverslab.com/)

*I think LoversLab is banned in some countries. You may need a VPN if LL has indeed been blocked.*

### Step Four: Acquire Wabbajack
Go to [Wabbajack.org](https://www.wabbajack.org/) and download the program.

Place the downloaded executable somewhere outside of any protected files. I have it placed in *C:\Modding\Wabbajack*. When you run this executable, is will automatically download the latest version of the entire Wabbajack program.

Once you've launched Wabbajack, click the settings button in the top right. Connect to your Nexus account.
